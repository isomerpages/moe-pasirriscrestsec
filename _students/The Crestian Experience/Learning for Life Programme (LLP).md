Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
=================================

  

**Objectives**

  

As the Music Satellite to the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Creative Arts, PRCS believes in providing a quality music education for Crestians to nurture their interest and talent in the performing arts. The exploration of music and other forms of the performing arts supports the holistic development of students, allowing them to discover and express themselves as well as to strengthen their character, giving rise to the focus of PRCS’ Learning for Life Programme (LLP),&nbsp;**Nurturing Crestian Learners of Tomorrow through Music and the Performing Arts**.  

  

The LLP brings together the school’s music programme and performing arts CCAs to help develop Crestians in the following areas:

  

*   **Learning of musical knowledge and skills**, to equip all students with a range of music skills to encourage them to pursue music as an interest beyond their school days.
*   **Learning of values and life skills through learning music and performance**, to develop core life skills and competencies anchored in values to enable students to be self-disciplined persons and leaders.
*   **Using music to serve and help others**, to inspire students’ spirit of volunteerism and empathy; to be conscious of one self’s potential and be empowered to contribute to the betterment of others.

  

**Outline**

  

The LLP comprises broad-based programmes to equip all students with basic skills in music and performance and appreciation for the performing arts (Tier 1). Students who demonstrate aptitude and passion for music and the performing arts also have various opportunities to further pursue and deepen their skills through a wide range of activities and interest groups/ performing arts CCAs (Tier 2).

A key component of the LLP is the music programme, which is delivered as level programmes for Secondary 1, 2 and 3. It consists of 3 main parts:  

  

**Part 1: Learning of Music for Growth (Lower Secondary)**  

  

All Crestians will be taught 3 musical instruments; Keyboard and Guitar/Ukulele (individual musical instrument) at Secondary One and Xylophone (ensemble performance) at Secondary Two. The learning of each musical instrument spans across a semester and comprises at least 15 hours of music lessons taught by our own Music Teachers.

Crestians will also spend a semester to learn music arrangement through ICT tools such as Garage Band. Selected enrichment programmes such as percussion workshops and attending external musical performances will also be organised to expose Crestians to different musical experiences.

All Crestians will acquire basic music skills to perform simple musical pieces and to create/arrange their own music.

**Part 2: Deepening the Learning of Music to Serve (Upper Secondary)**

  

Crestians are encouraged to infuse music learning and performance skills that they have picked up at Lower Secondary as part of the Crestians’ Values-In-Action Project in Secondary Three.&nbsp;  

  

A 20-hour level programme provides the opportunity for students to work as a class to plan and conceptualise their VIA project and to apply creatively the musical skills learnt in lower secondary to enhance their quality of their project.

  

With guidance from Music Teachers/Home Tutors, Crestians will plan and decide their VIA activities. Crestians could choose to deliver live performances at community/school-based events, e.g. National Education events, create musical pieces in songs or videos to advocate awareness towards specific social concerns, share the joy of music with others through teaching music to the young or underprivileged, etc.

The authentic learning experience for Crestians to create meaningful outcomes with their musical skills will inspire Crestians’ spirit of volunteerism. This is in line with the school’s goal to develop Crestians to become active and concerned citizens, paving the way for them to embark on a lifelong journey of active learning and helping others.  

  

**Part 3: Promoting Learning and Appreciation of Music**&nbsp;

  

To sustain a positive and vibrant school culture where students can enjoy music, the school would continue to organise different school-based events to promote the learning of musical skills and support the development of Crestians in the aesthetics.  

  

**Events and Competitions**  

  

The events include the annual Crestians Got Talent competition where talented Crestians showcase their varied skills in performance, and are guided by teachers in the course of working towards their final performance. Other platforms include regular recess outdoor performances, practice sessions for aspiring musicians to express and share their love for music, master classes for students pursuing the GCE ‘O’ Level Music, and the annual Cheering Competition for classes to unleash their creativity to compose cheers based on school values and to enhance their class identity.
