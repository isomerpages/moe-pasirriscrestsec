<h1>Education and Career Guidance</h1>
<div>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) equips students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for the successful transition from school to further education or work. This will enable students to manage their career pathways and inculcate a desire for lifelong learning throughout their lives. The programme develops social emotional competencies and qualities such as adaptability and resilience, which ensures that students are prepared for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. It is an important step to ensure that our students remain competitive in the global economy, and lead productive and meaningful lives.</p>
<p>The objectives of the PRCS ECG programme are as follow:</p>
<br /><br />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Enable students to explore viable education and career options through the provision of accurate and comprehensive information.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All students are guided to use the <a href="https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/secondary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySkillsFuture</a> portal to support their exploration of post-secondary education and career options. There are also level-specific support structures available to guide students as they consider various ECG-related options. For example, Secondary Two students will undergo preparatory briefings on subject combination matters at the beginning of the year, and embark on learning journeys to MOE-organised ECG Fairs to gain a more in-depth understanding of in-demand skillsets required by the various industrial sectors.</p>
<p>Upper Secondary students can also look forward to the annual PRCS ECG Fair and visits to the Lifelong Learning Institute, where they will gain access to information on the various post-secondary education and career pathways. They will also visit the various post-secondary education institutions to experience for themselves how teaching and learning is carried out in these higher education institutes, in order to make informed choices on their future education and career options.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2. Nurture students' self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills for continuous learning and training.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The school implements processes to help students develop critical social and emotional competencies and life skills, which will help them adapt and adjust to future challenges as they embark on their journeys in higher education and future careers. At the beginning of each school year, time will be allocated for students to set educational goals which will be aligned to the school's Desired Student Learning Outcomes (DSLOs). These goals will then be reviewed at the end of each semester, where Home Tutors will provide feedback on how students can direct their learning behaviour effectively in order to achieve their stated goals.</p>
<p>Upper Secondary students will also participate in workshops to hone their skills in effective communication, resume-writing and personal grooming, which will support them in their application to the post-secondary education institutions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Inculcate an appreciation for the value of all occupations and how they contribute to the well-functioning of society.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The school invites guest speakers and alumni from a wide range of occupations to share their experiences with the students during the ECG Fair, assembly programmes and the annual Speech and Prize-Giving Day. When possible, information on the latest industry trends and labour market outlook are disseminated to students through the ECG lessons. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4. Equip our students with skills and means to positively engage their parents and other career influencers.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The school believes in proving opportunities for students to engage the community as they explore their education and career options. Through the Parents-Teacher Meetings (PTM), student, parents and Home Tutors come together to review the DSLO goals, and discuss possible career options and educational pathways that might be suitable for the student. Parents are also engaged during the Secondary Two Subject Combination briefing, which will provide both student and parents with sufficient information to make decisions which are aligned with the students' educational and career goals.</p>
<div>Through school and MOE-organised ECG Fairs, students will be given the opportunity to engage with sector-specific industry experts and representatives from the post-secondary educational institutes on their educational and career preferences. Opportunities for such engagements are guided by the Home Tutors and the ECG counsellor during ECG lessons, where students are encouraged to reflect on their own interests, strengths and aptitude as they consider their desired education and career options.</div>
