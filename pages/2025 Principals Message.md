<p>The school theme for 2025 is a continuation of our journey towards the
renewed school vision ‘Our Caring Home, Our CRESTian Leaders’.</p>
<p>In 2022, we set off, working towards a unified school identity of ‘OUR
PRCS’.</p>
<p>In 2023, we reinforced that unified identity by reminding ourselves, the
school values and dispositions that we must embrace and embody and hence,
our school theme ‘OUR CREST’.</p>
<p>In 2024, we amalgamated our school values with the desired behaviour for
each Crestian staff and student - ‘Our CRESTian Leaders’, reminding ourselves
of self-leadership and role-modelling.</p>
<p>This year, in 2025, we move beyond self, onto others. We believe and remind
ourselves that school is part of a bigger community. With our CREST values,
we transform PRCS as a caring home, not just for ourselves and each other
within PRCS, but also beyond. ‘Our Caring Home’ thus signifies our commitment
towards reinforcing our Culture of Care as a school. More importantly,
it demands of us to empathise multiple perspectives, to understand happenings
beyond and to contribute towards building a more cohesive community.</p>
<p>‘Our Caring Home’, the school theme for 2025 is therefore one that directs
others-centredness through grounded values and civic literacy.</p>
<p>Join us, and contribute to Our Caring Home together!</p>
