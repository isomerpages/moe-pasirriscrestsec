<p align="justify">The school theme for 2025 is a continuation of our journey towards the renewed school vision ‘Our Caring Home, Our CRESTian Leaders’.</p>
<p align="justify">In 2022, we set off, working towards a unified school identity of ‘OUR PRCS’. </p>
<p align="justify">In 2023, we reinforced that unified identity by reminding ourselves, the school values and dispositions that we must embrace and embody and hence, our school theme ‘OUR CREST’. </p>
<p align="justify">In 2024, we amalgamated our school values with the desired behaviour for each Crestian staff and student - ‘Our CRESTian Leaders’, reminding ourselves of self-leadership and role-modelling. </p>
<p align="justify">This year, in 2025, we move beyond self, onto others. We believe and remind ourselves that school is part of a bigger community. With our CREST values, we transform PRCS as a caring home, not just for ourselves and each other within PRCS, but also beyond. ‘Our Caring Home’ thus signifies our commitment towards reinforcing our Culture of Care as a school. More importantly, it demands of us to empathise multiple perspectives, to understand happenings beyond and to contribute towards building a more cohesive community.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Our Caring Home’, the school theme for 2025 is therefore one that directs others-centredness through grounded values and civic literacy.</p>
<p align="justify">Join us, and contribute to Our Caring Home together!</p>

<p align="justify">The school theme for 2024 showcases the continuity in our journey toward achieving our school vision: ‘Our Caring Home, Our CRESTian Leaders’. </p>
<p align="justify">In 2022, we commenced our journey by working towards a unified school identity, encapsulated in ‘OUR PRCS’. </p>
<p align="justify">In 2023, we reinforced that unified identity by reminding ourselves of the school values and dispositions that we must embrace, thus adopting the school theme ‘OUR CREST’.  </p>
<p align="justify">In 2024, we continue building on the progress of the past two years, now focusing on a specific goal for each Crestian staff and student – ‘Our CRESTian Leaders’. </p>
<p align="justify">We believe that every Crestian can be a leader by leading oneself, learning conscientiously, thinking critically and serving wholeheartedly. A CRESTian leader hence is one who demonstrates self-leadership in upholding the school values of Care, Resilience, Excellence, Self-Belief and Trustworthiness, in beliefs, actions and words. </p>
<p align="justify">‘Our CRESTian Leaders’ refers to both our staff and our students. As staff, we aim to role model the school values and desired self-leadership, thereby inspiring our students to do the same. We aspire to speak and act with conviction in line with these values, guiding us toward self-leadership and enabling us to lead others as well. As students, our goal is to comprehend and embody these school values. We must lead ourselves and hold ourselves accountable for these values, thereby nurturing a moral culture and reminding others to uphold them too. </p>
<p align="justify">‘Our CRESTian Leaders’ symbolises a unified effort and a shared vision. </p>
<p align="justify">I invite you to join us on this journey, carry this shared vision and partner with us to realise it! </p>
