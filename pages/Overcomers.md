<div>“I have always known that life is a constant struggle,” recalls T. Sreedharan of Secondary 5NA.  Struggling with motor issues indicative of dyspraxia, he has difficulties coordinating his hand movements and this often results in poor penmanship.  Sree also suffers from a speech impediment which causes him to lisp.  Dealing with two major issues is certainly no mean feat.

“I am unable to write neatly no matter how hard I try,” Sree explains.  “My subject teachers have constantly been reminding me about the need to write legibly so that my work is understood by markers, especially for external examinations.  However, I remained stagnant and only saw a change when I entered Secondary Three.”

In Secondary Three, Sree met Ms. Kaur and Mr. Fahmy.  “Ms. Kaur has been my English teacher for almost 3 years now and even then, when I first met her, she would constantly encourage me to go beyond my perceived limits,” Sree recalls.  “She does not accept assignments that are done shabbily, so I have had to write my essays multiple times before in order to meet her high standards.”  

“Mr Fahmy, my Maths teacher, actually sourced for and printed out handwriting assessments for me to complete!  These two teachers went above and beyond the call of duty to help me overcome my handwriting issues and gave me confidence to write legibly.  Eventually, I managed to overcome my difficulties and scored well for my N Level exams. This would not have been possible without the help of these two amazing teachers.”

Besides having issues with his handwriting, Sree also had a lisp.  He was afraid of speaking to people and delivering speeches was a tough task for him.  He is grateful for the opportunities given in his CCA, the Media Communications Club (MCC), in helping him overcome his speech impediment.

“Gavel Club meetings offered opportunities to let me speak in a safe and non-judgmental environment,” Sree explains.  “Members and teachers were encouraging and our efforts were always recognised and celebrated.  By the time I entered Secondary Three, I had already obtained my Toastmasters Competent Communicator Certificate, an internationally recognised public speaking qualification. My CCA also gave me exposure to debating and this further honed my ability to think quickly on my feet and overcome my fear of public speaking.”

Eventually, Sree was nominated to serve as Vice-President of the MCC from 2018 to 2019.  This leadership opportunity pushed him to further develop his confidence in public speaking and debating and over time, his lisp disappeared.

“As cliché as it sounds – no matter where life takes you, you must always rise above your feelings of self-doubt,” Sree laughs.  “Remember that your mistakes are your biggest professors.”

“Do not beat yourselves up over what goes wrong and always have the mindset of being forward-looking in becoming a better version of yourself every day.”</div>
