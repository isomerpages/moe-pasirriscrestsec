<h1><strong>Parent School Communication</strong></h1>
<p>At PRCS, we value working closely with parents to nurture our students’
holistic development and well-being. Parents can use the following official
modes of communication with the school:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Phone (General Office): 6581 1655</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">prcss@moe.edu.sg</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mailing Address: 11 Pasir Ris Street 41 Singapore 518934</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Teachers could share their contact information (email address and office
extension) with students for ease of communications and clarifications.
As teachers nurture self-management and a sense of responsibility in students
and to promote respectful communications and well-being, teacher-student
communication such as text messages would be kept within school days and
not go beyond 5:30 p.m. (or 5:45 p.m. on Thursdays), unless there is urgent
and unforeseen situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In working with parents for the holistic development and well-being of
Crestians, teachers’ workload in partnering parents will be managed in
balance with our core professional duties, particularly in teaching and
learning. Hence, parents should only communicate and engage with teachers
within school hours (7.30 a.m. – 5.30 p.m./5:45 p.m. on Thursdays) during
school days.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Teachers are not expected to respond to parents’ and students’ queries
after school hours, during the weekends and school holidays. Teachers are
also not expected to provide their personal mobile numbers to parents /
students. If a teacher shares their personal mobile number to a student,
it is meant only for the student to communicate with the teacher on school
matters.&nbsp; The mobile number should not be shared without the teachers’
consent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For urgent queries and messages, parents can also contact the school’s
General Office at 6581 1655 or email the school at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">prcss@moe.edu.sg</a> as
teachers could be in class and are uncontactable during school hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let us all role-model gracious and respectful communications. The school
owes a duty of care to its teachers and staff.&nbsp; This is to protect
them from intimidating or threatening behaviour in a verbal or written
form. The school reserves the right not to engage parents under such circumstances.</p>

<p>We thank you for your support and look forward to an enriching partnership
which will help enhance your child’s learning and growth in the school
and build a positive and effective relationship between the school and
parents.</p>
