<p><strong>Brief Description of CCA</strong></p>
<p>Modern Dance is all about the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself.</p>

<p><strong>CCA Training and Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Dancers are not just performing artists. Their bodies are also the instruments through which the art is created. The quality of this art, therefore, necessarily depends on the physical qualities and skills that dancers possess. The stronger and more flexible a dancer&rsquo;s body, the more capable it is of a wide range of movement.</p>
<p><strong>Why Dance?</strong></p>
<p>Great dancers are not great because of their technique, they are great because of their passion!</p>
<p><strong>Expectations of CCA</strong></p>
<p>All dancers are expected to give their fullest commitment to trainings, attendance, competition and assigned routines and choreography.</p>
