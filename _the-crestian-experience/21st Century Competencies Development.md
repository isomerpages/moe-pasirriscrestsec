<p>In line with our mission of being <em>“A Choice School that nurtures the hearts and minds of Crestian leaders to be the pride of family, community and nation,”</em> Pasir
Ris Crest Secondary has, since its inception, provided a rigorous and holistic
curriculum. Through this, we seek to develop every Crestian into a <strong>Leader and Overcomer</strong>—equipped
with the right mindset and skills, grounded in strong character, and confident
to pursue and overcome life’s challenges.</p>
<p>In preparing our students for life in the 21st century, the school has
identified <strong>five Desired Student Learning Outcomes (DSLOs)</strong> that
guide the design of all our programmes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Active and Engaged Learner</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive Problem Solver</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effective Communicator</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Disciplined and Responsible Leader</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Active and Concerned Citizen with Global Awareness</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>To achieve these outcomes, our curriculum is thoughtfully designed to
provide every student with a <strong>distinctively Crestian learning experience</strong>.</p>
<p>Building on students’ mastery of subject knowledge, our teachers customise
learning programmes such as our distinctive <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/prcss-alp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Enhanced Applied Learning Programme (EALP) in Effective Communication</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/prcss-curriculum/curriculum-home/e-l" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Literary Week</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/prcss-curriculum/curriculum-home/sci" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Science Investigative Projects</a></strong>,
and the <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/prcss-curriculum/curriculum-home/act" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Integrated Aesthetics, Craft and Technology Project</a></strong>.
These programmes help students apply their learning meaningfully and authentically.</p>
<p>Our co-curricular offerings are anchored on key unique strengths of the
school, including our <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/prcss-ccas/sports/fencing?authuser=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Niche Programme in Fencing</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/prcss-leadership/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Student Leadership Development</a></strong>,
as well as our robust <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/prcss-curriculum/curriculum-home/cce" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">in-house Character and Citizenship Education curriculum</a></strong>.
Signature experiences such as <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/prcss-curriculum/curriculum-home/pe" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PRCS Cheering Competition</a></strong>,
and the <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/prcss-start-it-right-programme" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Start It Right Programme</a></strong> further
