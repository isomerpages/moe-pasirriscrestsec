<h1>21st Century Competencies Development</h1> 
<p align="justify">In line with our mission of "A&nbsp;Choice School that nurtures the Hearts and Minds of Crestian Leaders to be the pride of family, community and nation",&nbsp;Pasir Ris Crest Secondary has since our school’s inception sought to provide a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum for all Crestians to develop to become Overcomers with the mind set and skills, anchored on the strength of their character, to pursue and realise challenges in life.

In our efforts to be a school for the 21st century, the school identified 5 Desired Student Learning Outcomes on which all programmes are focused upon:
</p><ul align="left">
<li>Active and Engaged Learner</li>
<li>Innovative Problem Solver</li>
<li>Effective Communicator</li>
<li>Self-Disciplined and Responsible Leader</li>
<li>Active and Concerned Citizen with Global Awareness</li>
	</ul>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">To these ends, the school leadership sets the direction for all staff in charting the flagship programmes experienced by Crestians and empowers both the Key Personnel and teachers in consolidating, reviewing and revamping these programmes to ensure the delivery of a uniquely Crestian experience for all students. Building on their mastery of the subjects, the staff customised curricular programmes such as the English Language Department Applied Learning Programme, the&nbsp;<a href="/files/21cc_development/star_challenge.pdf">Shooting Star Challenge</a>&nbsp;by Science, the&nbsp;<a href="/files/21cc_development/math_trail.pdf">Math Trail</a><a>, the Humanities Map Challenge and the&nbsp;</a><a href="/files/21cc_development/inter_disciplinary_programme.pdf">Inter-disciplinary Programme on Environment Conversation</a>
	
</p><p align="justify">Anchoring on our Niche programme in Fencing and our resources in Music, as well as the strength of our in-house Character and Citizenship Education Programme, the staff are empowered to customise co-curricular programmes that marked the journey of Crestians including the infusion of 21CC into the Fencing, Adventurous Journey, VIA and Music components of the National Youth Achievement Award Programme and the various Co-curricular Activities.</p>
