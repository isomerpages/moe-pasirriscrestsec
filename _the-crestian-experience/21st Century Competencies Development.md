<p>In line with our mission of "A Choice School that Nurtures the Hearts
and Minds of Crestian Leaders to be the pride of family, community and
nation", Pasir Ris Crest Secondary has since our school’s inception sought
to provide a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum for all Crestians to
develop to become Leaders and Overcomers with the mindset and skills, anchored
