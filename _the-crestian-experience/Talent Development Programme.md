<h1>Talent Development Programme</h1>
<p></p>
<p>At PRCS, we believe that every child is unique and recognise that they
can and will demonstrate talents in different domains and at different
stages throughout their secondary school years.</p>
<p>Hence, we have our in-house STRETCH<sup>3</sup> (<strong>STRE</strong>ng<strong>T</strong>hs
of <strong>C</strong>restians – <strong>H</strong>ead, <strong>H</strong>eart, <strong>H</strong>and)
talent development structure to ensure that while all students are exposed
to different learnings, their unique strengths are also recognised and
developed.</p>
<p>In line with PRCS’ Desired Student Learning Outcomes that guard the development
of 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies, our STRETCH<sup>3</sup> progressive
design facilitates the advancement of students in different domains.</p>
