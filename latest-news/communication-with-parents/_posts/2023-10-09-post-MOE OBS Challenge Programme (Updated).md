Dear Parents/Guardians and Secondary 3 Crestians,

MOE-OBS Challenge Programme is part of the National Outdoor Adventure Education Master Plan which the Ministry of Education (MOE) has put in place to strengthen the holistic development of all our students. The programme seeks to develop ruggedness, resilience, and build cohesion amongst our youths. The programme comprises a series of school-based PE and CCE lessons as well as a 5-day residential course at Outward Bound Singapore (OBS).

Through the course, our students will learn to:

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manage challenges positively through self-directed learning and making the right choices to influence their circumstances. <br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appreciate the natural heritage of Singapore and recognise that everyone plays a part.

Enclosed below are the pdf copies of the presentation that were shared with the parents and students as well as the packing list for the course. You may refer to the document for more details.<br>
