Physical Education
==================

INTRODUCTION
------------

**_Vision_**: Every Crestian, physically educated to lead an active and healthy lifestyle.

  

The PE department believes that fundamental motor skills and core values provide a strong foundation for the learning, participation and enjoyment of a wide variety of physical activities. In their 4 or 5 years with our school, the students are exposed to 8 different types of sports (namely educational gymnastic, netball, badminton, softball, basketball, volleyball, tchoukball and floorball) to enhance their learning experience. We hope that the students will continue to adopt active lifestyle and play these sports at recreational level in their adulthood, in alignment with Sports Singapore Vision 2030 of “Live Better Through Sports”. As part of PE syllabus 2014, students are also taught Outdoor Education (OE) and Physical Health and Fitness (PHF). These programmes help students to achieve the six goals of physical education. The Sec 2 and 4/5 students are trained physically to be ready for National Physical Fitness Assessment (NAPFA). Our students also take part in our annual cross country, interclass game, cheering competition, swimming programme and experiential learning that enhance their school experience.

ASSESSMENT IN PE
----------------

Sec 1 to 3 secondary students are assessed for their skills and concepts using rubrics in the 6 sports module, namely gymnastic, netball, badminton, softball, basketball and volleyball. The rubrics are set up based on the learning outcomes of these sports. Students are assessed in an authentic setting or game-like situation. Assessment for learning (Afl) are adopted during the curriculum and ongoing formative feedback are also given to the students throughout the 16-hour module to help the students to improve their skills and understanding of games concept. Peer assessment is also implemented for each sport to improve the skills of the students through the feedback given by their classmates. In addition, the students are also being assessed in their affective domain on participation during PE. The overall assessment, in PE grade, will be reflected in the student’s result slip at the end of the year.

  

In addition, the department believes that PE is a platform to inculcate sound values, like integrity, respect, build their character and infuse the students with 21st Century Competencies during their formative years. Routine are set, lessons are designed purposefully and teachable moments are seized to imbue the students with these values and competencies to prepare the students to face the challenges in life.

SCHOOL-WIDE PROGRAMME
---------------------

CROSS COUNTRY
-------------

The annual cross country is held at Pasir Ris Park. In the lead up to the cross country, students train for their run during PE lessons. Besides strengthening their fitness, the training allows them to learn the importance of values, like self-discipline, perseverance and resilience that enable them to complete the race. The cross country also promotes a healthy lifestyle among the students and staff.

CHEERING COMPETITION
--------------------

Cheering competition is an unique feature of PRCS. Prior to this competition, the entire class, together with their Home Tutors, spend time together to prepare and rehearse for the cheering competition. Led by their peers in their class, the students learn to choreograph a cheer of about 3 to 4 minutes to perform on stage as a class. Many creative cheers were devised by the students that involved physical coordinated movement, innovative cheering lyrics and use of props. Through this process, the students learn to work together as a team, peer leadership and relationship management during the process.

ANNUAL SEC 1 TO 4/5 INTER-CLASS GAMES (ICG)
-------------------------------------------

The objectives of the ICG for Sec 1 to 4/5 students are to encourage mass participation in sports, provide a platform for classes to compete and cheer for their class and promote healthy living. Students get the chance to play and compete in different sports, like floorball, softball, tchoukball, netball, badminton, that they have learnt during PE lessons. Through the ICG, students also learn to work as a team and pick up important values, like fair play, respect and care for school mates.

ACES DAY AND TEACHERS VS STUDENTS GAME
--------------------------------------

On ACES Day, the whole school engages in a mass workout routine, led by student leaders. This is followed by Teacher-Student games like Captain’s Ball or Dodgeball, which allows the students to play against their teachers. It promotes bonding and builds rapport among staff and students.  

EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING PROGRAMME AT SPORTS HUB
---------------------------------------------

Sec 1 students worked in team to explore the Sports Hub through an amazing race format to apply what they learn from their Outdoor Education module in an unfamiliar setting, like pacing, navigation, risk assessment. Students also visited the sports museum to learn more about the role that sports play in nation building. They learn how sports can help Singaporeans to lead an active and healthy lifestyle, as well as the role that Sports Hub plays to encourage more Singaporeans to take part in sports.  

NATIONAL YOUTH ACHIEVEMENT AWARD (NYAA) PROGRAMME
-------------------------------------------------

Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School (PRCS) embarked National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) programme in 2002.  The school leverages on the various school programmes to satisfy the NYAA’s criteria and allowing the entire Sec 2 cohort to achieve the bronze award. For the silver award, the students are encouraged to sign up for the programme when they are in Secondary 3.

  

The school uses National Youth Achievement Programme to serves as a platform to equip our students with the skills to develop and maximise their potentials. We believe that our NYAA programme plays an important part in bringing out the overcomer in every student. 

Through the programme, the students pick up schools values, Social Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies, like social awareness, and 21st Century Competencies, like critical and inventive thinking. These values, competencies and skills serve as part of the whole school approach towards holistic education of our students and to prepare them for the challenges in the future.

  

The NYAA Programme has three key components, which all participants are required to complete, namely:

1.      Healthy Living (Physical & Mental Wellness)

2.      Outdoor Appreciation (To be at Ease with Nature)

3.      Service Learning (Touching Lives, Making a Difference)

  

**Bronze Award**

The Sec 2 students fulfil their **Healthy Living** programme through their active participation during the Physical Education lessons during the year. The students learn sports modules, badminton and softball, during the lessons that allows them to develop them physically and pick up social emotional learning competencies that allows them to play as a team and mentally well. These help them to enjoy the sports and maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.

For the **Outdoor Appreciation** section, the students participate in a 3-day, 2-night outdoor adventure camp at the one of the local campsites to build their resilience and encourage them to go beyond their mental and physical limits. The camp helps our students to gain confidence in themselves and boost qualities of teamwork, self-reliance and perseverance

Under **Service Learning** section, the students get the chance to serve 15 hours of values in action by planning and executing a fund raising project during the School Carnival to help to raise fund for charitable children organisation under Community Chest.

In our school, we also encourage those who can, to work towards the attainment of the Silver award. Hence, Sec 3 students are encouraged to exercise their self-leadership by taking up the NYAA silver award programme to motivate themselves.

  

**Silver Award**

For the silver award, the students opt in to sign up to participate in the programme when they are in Sec 3 and carry on till mid year of Sec 4. They start their 32 hours of regular activities, like volleyball, basketball, floorball and tchoukball, during their PE lessons in Secondary Three and Four. The students participate in Outdoor Bound School (OBS)’s residential camp for their Outdoor Appreciation in Secondary 3. Students also serve 40 hours of community service on their own accord by contributing to various organizations through community work.

At the end of July and September of each year, the school holds a NYAA ceremony to give recognition to the bronze and silver awardees for their achievement.
