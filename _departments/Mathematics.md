MISSION
-------

To Foster A Vibrant Learning Environment Where All Crestians Develop Their Mathematical Ability To The Fullest Potential.

INTRODUCTION
------------

The Mathematics Department seeks to nurture all students to be self-motivated Mathematics learners through an effective instructional programme that develops their analytical thinking and problem solving skills.  Exposure to problems in real-world contexts is critical to students’ development in reasoning and communication.

SECONDARY ONE PERFORMANCE TASK
------------------------------

Through the performance task, students are given opportunities to showcase their critical and inventive thinking skills.  Students work in teams on their choice of projects.  Using an online collaborative platform, they collect, analyse and represent data, perform calculations and finally propose solutions to the problems posed.

MATHEMATICS TRAIL
-----------------

To enhance students’ learning experiences and provide opportunities for hands-on application of mathematical models and concepts in real-world contexts, the department organises and conducts Mathematics Trails at external venues like the Singapore Sports Hub and Our Tampines Hub.

NATIONAL COMPETITIONS
---------------------

National competitions provide students with a flair in Mathematics to maximise their potential and enable them to benchmark their skills against other participants.  Students in the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad programme undergo special training sessions to develop their higher order and critical thinking skills.  It is hoped that these would in turn provide them with opportunities to excel and help them grow their passion in Mathematics.

  

Some of these competitions include  

·       Singapore Mathematics Olympiad

·       UNSW School Mathematics Competition

·       All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competition for Normal Course Students
