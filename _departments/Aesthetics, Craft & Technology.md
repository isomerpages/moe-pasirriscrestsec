Aesthetics, Craft & Technology
==============================

INTRODUCTION
------------

**_Aesthetics, Craft and Technology_** (ACT) Department encompasses all coursework subject in PRCS. Design and Technology, Food and Nutrition, Art and Music. Before embarking on their theme-related projects, students are first grounded in basics of their respective disciplines. Coursework aims to realise student potential in product design, visual art creations, nutritional science, and music compositions.

INTEGRATED ACT PROJECTS
-----------------------

Teaches in ACT department seek to infuse I&E skillsets and encourage Crestians to adopt an innovative mindset in an interdisciplinary approach links ACT subjects via a common thematic framework and allows students to learn in the constructivist way.

In Secondary One, the students examine the elements of art and re-interpret the traditional art forms into contemporary form and vice versa. In addition, they learn the skill of communicating their ideas via doodling and sketching and eventually level up to 3D rendering. Furthermore, they explore the food system, from its origins to the market, focusing on nutrition and consumer issues.

In Secondary Two, the students seek business opportunities relating to the upcoming Singapore attraction, the Art Science Museum. They begin, by applying their design sketching skills to create an innovative souvenir. They then continue to design healthy set meals for intended tourists. Finally they design facade prints, drawing inspiration from the current Art exhibition and contextual environment. 

ENHANCED LEARNING VIA ICT
-------------------------

ICT tools are harnessed to excite our ICT savvy Crestians and more importantly, enhance the teaching and learning of coursework-based subjects.
