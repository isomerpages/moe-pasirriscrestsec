Humanities
==========

The Humanities Department adopts the Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) approach to engage our students in learning the Humanities. Experiential Learning is incorporated in the design of IBL lessons to provide authentic scenarios for students to acquire and apply their knowledge and skills. The department also integrates ICT in lessons to encourage self-directed and collaborative learning to prepare students for post-secondary education.
