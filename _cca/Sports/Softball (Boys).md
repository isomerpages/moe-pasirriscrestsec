<p><strong>Brief Description of CCA</strong></p>
<p>Softball is an enjoyable team sport where the players&rsquo; intelligence is as essential as their physical prowess. The game promotes both physical and mental strength in students.</p>
<p><strong>Achievements of CCA</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;B&rsquo; Boys participated in National Softball Championship 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members will also have the opportunity to participate in Singapore Recreational Club Softball Games as well as have friendly games with softball teams from other schools.</p>
<p><strong>CCA Training and Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Softball places equal emphasis on physical conditioning and softball skills to ready its members for the zonal and national tournaments. We invite other schools for friendly games so as to allow our boys to gain exposure. For committed members, we may offer competitions from external organisations to further enhance their softball skills. Our Softball coach was formerly from the National softball team, hence his experience will value add the coaching of our team.</p>
<p><strong>Why Softball?</strong></p>
<p>Softball is not just a physical, but is also an intellectual sport. It also builds team work among the softballers whereby students need to work as a team to achieve optimum results.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations of CCA</strong></p>
<p>All softball members are expected to turn up for all trainings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Trainings will be more intensive when competitions are near. Hence, we are looking for committed members who are determined and resilient. Members are to be physically healthy to undergo physical activities during each training session. No prior knowledge in Softball is needed as we will train every member from the fundamentals.</p>
