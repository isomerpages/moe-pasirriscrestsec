We provide the opportunity for students to learn the skills of playing the guzheng and to perform confidently on stage. Our instructor is Ms Yvonne Tay and we currently have 28 members from Secondary 1 to 3.</p>

<p><strong>Why Guzheng?</strong></p>
<p>We provide a good platform for students to learn how to play the instrument and make public performances. Our programme aims to instill discipline in our students as they work towards gaining mastery in the required skills. Students have the opportunity to learn to work together, to empathise with and support their peers. This helps them to build up teamwork and self- confidence. We support our students with opportunities to develop their leadership skills.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations of CCA</strong></p>
<p>No pre-requisite skills are required, although music background, especially in the instrument guzheng, is preferred. What is required is a keen interest in music and a strong commitment to learn the skills and attend all practice sessions, and a willingness to put in extra effort and time to prepare for performances.</p>
