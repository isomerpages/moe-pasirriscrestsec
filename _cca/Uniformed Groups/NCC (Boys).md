<p><strong>Why NCC (Boys)?</strong></p>
<p>The NCC provides a holistic education for our cadets and serves as a platform for character building. There are basic military skills training such as foot and arms drill and basic leadership grooming over the course of 4 to 5 years. This makes it easier for the male cadets to integrate into the National Service. Cadets who have completed their course of service will know what to expect in their Basic Military Training and this helps prepare them when they enlist.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations of CCA</strong></p>
<p>Cadets are to ensure regular attendance during training sessions and to be adventurous.</p>
