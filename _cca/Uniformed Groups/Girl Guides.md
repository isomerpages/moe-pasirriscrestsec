<p><strong>Brief Description of CCA</strong></p>
<p>Girl Guides are trained to observe the fundamental principles of the Guide Law and Promise through our 5-Point Programme. Our CCA sessions provides an enriched learning experience through the non-formal education method which has the following five essential elements:</p>
<p>1. Learning in small groups: The girls learn to support each other, value teamwork, negotiate, make democratic decisions, solve problems together and take the lead.</p>
<p>2. My path, my pace: The girls are given the autonomy to choose and complete the proficiency badge programmes within their patrols and unit.</p>
<p>3. Learning by doing: The girls learn to face challenges, take risks and learn through experience.</p>
<p>4. Connecting with others: The girls learn to value others, appreciate diversity, develop empathy and communicate.</p>
<p>5. Connecting with the world: The girls become active citizens who enjoy the outdoors. They get involved in our community through various Values In Action programmes.</p>

<p><strong>CCA Training and Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Looking for an enriching CCA experience? In Girl Guides, the girls participate in a wide range of activities to fulfil the criteria to earn numerous Proficiency Badges such as the Traditions to Guiding Badge, Green Fingers Badge, Olympia Badge, Friends to The Hearing Impaired Badge and Photographer Badge. The Girl Guides also embark on advocacy programmes in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, Free Being Me, Action on Body Confidence and Mental Health Awareness badge programmes. In addition, The Girl Guides contribute VIA hours in collaboration with the St John&rsquo;s Home for Elderly Persons and the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The girls participate in a range of HQ and division based events such as World Thinking Day, East Division Day, East Division Learning Day and National Brownie Revel where girls are given several opportunities to represent the school in competitions and facilitate workshops for Girl Guides and Brownies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highlight of the CCA programme is the annual Girl Guide camp where the girls get to participate in exciting outdoor activities such as outdoor cooking, tent pitching, gadget making and campfire.&nbsp;</p>
