### Our Fourth Principal
In January 2016, Mr Balamurugan Krishnasamy became PRCS’ fourth principal. In the year he was with us, he introduced the Advocacy Programme so that students’ voices and their concerns could be heard. He looked into pedagogy and strengthened AfL practices so that teachers’ competency in the classroom is levelled up. He made the physical environment more vibrant with the newly-renovated library, the public speaking podium in the parade square and the Piet Mondrian inspired colours for the school buildings.
