Dear parents and students,<br><br>
Welcome to PRCS <a href="http://gg.gg/prcss-360virtualtour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual tour</a>.<br><br>
We are pleased that you are here to find out more about us. This immersive virtual tour will take you to the common areas used by our Crestians. To join a short tour, you may wish to follow the routes: Time to Learn and Time to Bond.<br><br>
However, if you wish to discover more about our school, use the menu on the left side of the screen to navigate to different parts of our school from the Allegro Block to the Forte Block (A to F).<br><br>
Thank you.
