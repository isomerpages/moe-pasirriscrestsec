<p><strong>Reasons for Joining CIO</strong></p>
<p>The CIO aims to prepare our students for an increasingly globalised and complex future through the inculcation of values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies (21CC). Our students grow as they learn together, strive together, work with and lead one another in the CCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students also develop character such as empathy and resilience, as the continuum of authentic experiences allow them to develop, reflect on, and apply the values, competencies and skills that will help them thrive in the future.</p>
<p>Our orchestra is made up of Chinese as well as non-Chinese members to reflect our school&rsquo;s multi-racial population. This is also reflected in our motto, `Harmony in Race and Talent&rsquo;, whereby we are united despite our differences in race to create beautiful music. The friendships forged and the team spirit nurtured amongst students of different races and backgrounds are vital for social integration. So, if you love music and would like to learn to play instruments steeped in culture and history, come and join us. We welcome all races!</p>
<p><strong>Expectations of CCA</strong></p>
<p>Although a background in music is a big plus, it is NOT a requirement. The instructors are prepared to teach all students from scratch. If you have become proficient in one instrument, you will most probably acquire skills in more than one instrument in our CCA. However, having a passion for music, being disciplined and punctual for all practices are a must.</p>
