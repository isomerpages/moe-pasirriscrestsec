Our School Song
===============

Words & Music by Ken Low

**Verse 1:**

What we have is something special here

something so unique

What we have will last forever

The world will be at our feet

When you hold your hand right out to me

I see a glowing chance

Spark the burning flame inside of me

**Chorus:**

Show me the way, show me the signs

Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find

Find within myself, capacities to excel

Bring out the love, here in our hearts

Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way  
Stand together, with the love we'll always share  
Show me the way 

**Verse 2:**

When you have your hopes around me  
Showing that you care  
I'm not afraid to make it happen  
Knowing that you're there  
Stars will rise and stars will shine  
and memories will remain  
It's a seed that grows within me everyday. 

**Chorus:**

Show me the way, show me the signs  
Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find  
Find within myself, capacities to excel  
Bring out the love, here in our hearts  
Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way  
Stand together, with the love we'll always share  
Show me the way
