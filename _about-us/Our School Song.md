<p>Words & Music by Ken Low</p>
	
<p><strong>Verse 1:</strong></p>
	
<div align="justify">What we have is something special here<br/>
something so unique<br/>
What we have will last forever<br/>
The world will be at our feet<br/>
When you hold your hand right out to me<br/>
I see a glowing chance<br/>
Spark the burning flame inside of me</div>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p>
<div align="justify">Show me the way, show me the signs<br/>
Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find<br/>
Find within myself, capacities to excel<br/>
Bring out the love, here in our hearts<br/>
Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way<br />
Stand together, with the love we'll always share<br />
Show me the way</div>
	
<p><strong>Verse 2:</strong></p>
	
<div align="justify">When you have your hopes around me<br />
	Showing that you care<br />
	I'm not afraid to make it happen<br />
	Knowing that you're there<br />
	Stars will rise and stars will shine<br />
	and memories will remain<br />
	It's a seed that grows within me everyday.</div>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p>
<div align="justify">Show me the way, show me the signs<br />
	Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find<br />
	Find within myself, capacities to excel<br />
	Bring out the love, here in our hearts<br />
	Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way<br />
	Stand together, with the love we'll always share<br />
	Show me the way
</div>
