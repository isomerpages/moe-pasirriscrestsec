<p><strong>Verse 1:</strong></p>
<div>What we have is something special here</div>
<div>something so unique</div>
<div>What we have will last forever</div>
<div>The world will be at our feet</div>
<div>When you hold your hand right out to me</div>
<div>I see a glowing chance</div>
<div>Spark the burning flame inside of me</div>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p>
<div>Show me the way, show me the signs</div>
<div>Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find</div>
<div>Find within myself, capacities to excel</div>
<div>Bring out the love, here in our hearts</div>
Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way<br />Stand together, with the love we'll always share<br />Show me the way
<p><strong>Verse 2:</strong></p>
<p>When you have your hopes around me<br />Showing that you care<br />I'm not afraid to make it happen<br />Knowing that you're there<br />Stars will rise and stars will shine<br />and memories will remain<br />It's a seed that grows within me everyday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p>
<p>Show me the way, show me the signs<br />Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find<br />Find within myself, capacities to excel<br />Bring out the love, here in our hearts<br />Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way<br />Stand together, with the love we'll always share<br />Show me the way</p>
