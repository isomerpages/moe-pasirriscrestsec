<p>Lyrics by Ken Low
<br>Music arranged by Iskandar Ismail</p>
<p><strong>Verse 1:</strong>
<br>What we have is something special here
<br>Something so unique
<br>What we have will last forever
<br>The world will be at our feet
<br>When you hold your hand right out to me
<br>I see a glowing chance
<br>Spark the burning flame inside of me</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
<br>Show me the way, show me the signs
<br>Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find
<br>Find within myself, capacities to excel
<br>Bring out the love, here in our hearts
<br>Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way
<br>Stand together, with the love we'll always share
<br>Show me the way</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2:</strong>
<br>When you have your hopes around me
<br>Showing that you care
<br>I'm not afraid to make it happen
<br>Knowing that you're there
<br>Stars will rise and stars will shine
<br>And memories will remain
<br>It's a seed that grows within me everyday.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
<br>Show me the way, show me the signs
<br>Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find
<br>Find within myself, capacities to excel
<br>Bring out the love, here in our hearts
<br>Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way
<br>Stand together, with the love we'll always share
<br>Show me the way</p>
