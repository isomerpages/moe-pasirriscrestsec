<p align="justify">With the rapid changes in the educational landscape and shifts in the global environment, PRCS undertook a re-envisioning exercise in 2021 to ensure that it continues to remain relevant in educating its students for the 21st Century and prepare Crestians for the future workplace. 

The school’s re-envisioning exercise included soliciting feedback through conversations held with key stakeholders during staff engagement sessions, student focus group discussions, School Advisory Committee engagement as well as gathering feedback from parents.  After a year of generative conversations, the school’s renewed Mission, Vision and Values was officially launched during the school’s 22th Speech Day held on 22 April (Fri) 2022. 

The renewed Mission Statement, Vision Statement and School Values are: 

Mission: A Choice School that nurtures the Hearts and Minds of Crestian Leaders to be the pride of family, community and nation. 

Vision: Our Caring Home, Our CRESTian Leaders 

Values: Care, Resilience, Excellence, Self-Belief, Trustworthiness 

The refreshed school Values guides the actions and behaviour of our Crestians in terms of how they lead their lives, interact with one another in the school, community and nation and it serves as a compass for our students to navigate a shared future together.</p>
