On 6 August, we sealed our very own Time Capsule, Tempus, which depicted the growth of our school from the year 2000 to 2020, and our journey in building a Choice School and a Caring Home.   

It contained items for each year that showcased our achievements, key programmes and milestones, and will be opened in the year 2030 as part of our 30th Anniversary celebrations.
