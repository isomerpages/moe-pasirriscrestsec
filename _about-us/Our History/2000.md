#### **The Beginning**
Pasir Ris Crest Secondary started in the Millennium Year with 16 staff and 320 students. Mrs Teo Khin Hiang was the pioneer Principal who began the relentless effort to make the school one of the top choice schools for Primary Six pupils in Pasir Ris.

The construction of the school building commenced in June 1998 and the official Handover Ceremony took place in 16 December 1999.

#### **East Zone Centre of Excellence for Music**
Under the leadership of the first principal, Mrs Teo Khin Hiang, the school became the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Music in 2000. The inauguration of COE Music was graced by then Minister for Education Rear Admiral (NS) Teo Chee Hean, who also officially opened the school Audio Library in 2002. In the same year, the school’s radio station, ‘Rev It Up’ was officially opened by the then Minister of State for Education and Manpower Dr Ng Eng Hen. The Centre has since then provided opportunities to many students to pursue different genres of music and develop their talents.
