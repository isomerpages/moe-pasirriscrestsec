The theme for PRCS’ 20th Anniversary was Overcomers, We! This logo was designed by ex-teacher Ms Quek Jia Qi and was “grounded by symbols of the mountains, ocean, and sun rays, interconnected and unified to form the ‘20’ icon”.

&nbsp;Indeed, our journey in 2020 truly fitted the theme. In the nation’s fight against COVID-19, Crestian staff role-modelled what an Overcomer looked like and worked together to adapt swiftly into Circuit Breaker and Home-based Learning to best meet Crestians’ needs. Post-Circuit Breaker, Crestians remained vigilant, responsive and optimistic.

Despite the constraints, PRCS commemorated our 20th Anniversary with a composite mural with Zentangles drawn by staff, students and parents. The mural intended to showcase unity and celebrate the achievements and challenges that we have overcome in the face of adversity. This mural is currently displayed in Hangout@Crest.
