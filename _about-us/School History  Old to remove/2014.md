### Applied Learning and Learning for Life Programme

The school’s proposed Applied Learning Programme, Crestian Communicators of the 21st Century, and the Learning for Life Programme, Nurturing Crestian Learners of Tomorrow through Music and the Performing Arts were approved by MOE in 2014.
 
The school’s Applied Learning Programme seeks to enhance the learning of communication skills for all our students as they are essential skills to thrive in the 21st Century. The ability to think on one’s feet, and present lucid and sound arguments are important and necessary skills to work in today’s globalised world. On top of the school’s oral skills and Critical and Spontaneous Writing Programme, students go through a 4-year programme that comprises of storytelling, news reporting and broadcasting, dramatisation and persuasive communication.
 
The Learning for Life Programme seeks to equip students with a range of music skills to encourage them to pursue music as an interest beyond school days. Through learning music and performance, students learn values and life skills to be self-disciplined persons and leaders. Music is used to serve and help others through infusing music in the Values-in-Action projects. The learning of music supports the holistic development of students, addressing their needs in various domains such as intellectual, emotional and social, and allowing them to use music to express themselves.
