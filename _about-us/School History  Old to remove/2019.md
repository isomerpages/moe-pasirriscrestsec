### National Day Parade 2019
2019 marks a major milestone in the journey of Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School.  For the first time in the school’s history, our entire Secondary One cohort performed in the Show segment of National Day Parade (NDP) held on 9th August at the Padang.  Based on the NDP 2019 theme of “Our Singapore”, the Show segment comprised six acts and involved the largest proportion of youth performers in a decade. Our Secondary One students performed in Act Five, titled “Our Dreams”, which called for all Singaporeans to unite and be pioneers of the future.  The months of hard work put in by both students and staff resulted in a lively and well-synchronised display of iconic landmarks in Singapore, embellished with laser effects to evoke a vision of a future filled with energy and hope.  The eventual entry of a six-metre tall metallic lion puppet, the tallest prop in NDP’s recent history, segued Act Five smoothly into Act Six, in which Singaporean performers of all ages assembled to sing a variety of NDP songs.  The fireworks segment, which was launched from the Padang, Marina Bay, and Singapore River, ended the Show in a spectacular and fitting tribute to our nation’s 54th birthday.
