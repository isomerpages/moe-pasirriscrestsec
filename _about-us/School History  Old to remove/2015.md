### PRCS 15th Anniversary Celebrations

In 2015, PRCS celebrated its 15th Anniversary with the theme Appreciate. Celebrate. Anticipate. We appreciate the efforts by all stakeholders, students and staff who have contributed to the building of the school to where it is today, celebrate the many milestones that the school has crossed, the challenges overcome and successes achieved by both students and staff, and anticipate the coming of age of PRCS as A Choice School, A Caring Home, marked by the achievements of students and staff.
 
To commemorate this significant milestone, the year was lined up with several events. The PRCS Jog-a-thon was a fund-raiser that involved all students, to encourage them to show care for others by raising funds for needy students. To build school spirit and stretch studentsâ€™ potential, our first-ever record-breaking event PRCS Breaks Record! was held. We successfully set two Singapore Book of Records for the Longest Cheering Relay and Longest Body Percussion Chain. The school also broke the Guinness World Record for the Longest Body Percussion Chain! Once again, PRCS proved that what we believe is what we will achieve! Our 15th Anniversary Homecoming Dinner brought together graduates and students for a grand reunion.  We ended our celebrations on a high note with our public PRCS 15th Anniversary Musical. The musical was an enormous success and provided an opportunity for our students to showcase their talents in the performing arts.
