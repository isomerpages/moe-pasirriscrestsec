<p>The school crest pays homage to the word ‘Crest’, which is part of the
school’s name due to its location on an elevated part of the Pasir Ris
neighbourhood. The definitions of ‘Crest’ – the highest part of the hill
and the top of a wave – symbolise the positions that the school aspires
for its students to aim towards, pursue and attain in all arenas of their
lives, in line with the school motto, ‘Pursue and Realise Challenges’.</p>
