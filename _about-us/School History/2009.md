### Re-envisioning
A re-envisioning exercise led by school leaders that involved all PRCS staff took place as the school entered its 10th year. Staff members reflected on the challenges and achievements made by the school. At the end of the envisioning exercise, the new Vision “A Choice School. A Caring Home”, and the new Mission – “Nurturing TOMORROW’s Citizens, who are the pride of the family, Society and Nation, TODAY” provided the direction and motivation for the school in the next phase of its development. By this time, the identity of students have evolved to be that a Crestian-Overcomer, aligned to the school motto of Pursue and Realise Challenges.
