### Twinning Programme
The school’s twinning programme with Nan Hai Experimental Middle School in Guangdong province, China, aims to broaden our students’ perspectives, learn about other cultures and interact with fellow students from different backgrounds.

Both schools signed the memorandum of understanding formalizing the twinning agreement on 10th November 2008.
