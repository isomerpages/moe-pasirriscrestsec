### The Beginning of NYAA
The National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Programme is the schoolâ€™s flagship programme that is offered to all students. Through a systematic and structured programme, all students acquire a new skill, involve themselves in 15 hours of community service, participate in at least 20 hours of physical recreation and take part in a rugged, 2-day adventure. The school has continued to be one of the top schools in the National Youth Achievement Award programme.
