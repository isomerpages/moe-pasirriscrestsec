<p align="justify">The school theme for 2024 showcases the continuity in our journey toward achieving our school vision: ‘Our Caring Home, Our CRESTian Leaders’. </p>

<p align="justify">In 2022, we commenced our journey by working towards a unified school identity, encapsulated in ‘OUR PRCS’. </p>

<p align="justify">In 2023, we reinforced that unified identity by reminding ourselves of the school values and dispositions that we must embrace, thus adopting the school theme ‘OUR CREST’.  </p>

<p align="justify">In 2024, we continue building on the progress of the past two years, now focusing on a specific goal for each Crestian staff and student – ‘Our CRESTian Leaders’. </p>

<p align="justify">We believe that every Crestian can be a leader by leading oneself, learning conscientiously, thinking critically and serving wholeheartedly. A CRESTian leader hence is one who demonstrates self-leadership in upholding the school values of Care, Resilience, Excellence, Self-Belief and Trustworthiness, in beliefs, actions and words. </p>

<p align="justify">‘Our CRESTian Leaders’ refers to both our staff and our students. As staff, we aim to role model the school values and desired self-leadership, thereby inspiring our students to do the same. We aspire to speak and act with conviction in line with these values, guiding us toward self-leadership and enabling us to lead others as well. As students, our goal is to comprehend and embody these school values. We must lead ourselves and hold ourselves accountable for these values, thereby nurturing a moral culture and reminding others to uphold them too. </p>

<p align="justify">‘Our CRESTian Leaders’ symbolises a unified effort and a shared vision. </p>

<p align="justify">I invite you to join us on this journey, carry this shared vision and partner with us to realise it! </p>

<p align="justify">A warm welcome to Pasir Ris Crest Secondary!</p>
<!--<p align="justify">When you enter our campus, you will see the phrase &lsquo;Home of the Overcomers&rsquo;, shining beautifully under the warm rays. Indeed, this is our home, our PRCS, where we want all of you to be able to find your place, your growth, and strength to take on and overcome any challenge in life</p> -->
<p align="justify"> If you have ever heard us share about PRCS, you would remember our emphasis on our school culture of Care, Excellence and Positive Self-Belief. In PRCS, we believe that only with the desired culture, staff and students can find their place, learn and lead themselves towards the school's vision and mission.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Hence, every year, we have a school theme to galvanise our efforts and guide our focus in this process of culture building.</p>
	
<p align="justify">The school theme for 2022 was OUR PRCS, highlighting the singular and collective identity to be owned by all staff and students.</p>

<p align="justify">For 2023, our school theme is OUR CREST.</p>

<p align="justify">The determiner ‘OUR’ is retained to continue the emphasis on collective ownership, in line with the school vision. The school values represented by CREST are brought to the foreground, because we believe that values guide behaviours, and behaviours shape culture.</p>

<p align="justify">But what are our CREST values, and how do we want our staff and students to demonstrate them?</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p align="justify"><u><b>C</b></u>are: To Care is to demonstrate kindness, respect and empathy for others.</p></li>
<li><p align="justify"><u><b>R</b></u>esilience: To be Resilient is to persevere through adversities with a positive mindset, and recover with mental and emotional strength.</p></li>
<li><p align="justify"><u><b>E</b></u>xcellence: To pursue Excellence is to put in one’s best effort in all endeavours and to seek constant betterment of oneself.</p></li>
<li><p align="justify"><u><b>S</b></u>elf-belief: To have Self-belief is to have confidence in one’s ability while having the humility to learn continuously.</p></li>
<li><p align="justify"><u><b>T</b></u>rustworthiness: To be Trustworthy necessitates one to be a person of integrity and honesty, and thus, having the quality to be reliable and dependable when working and interacting with others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">PRCS seeks to inculcate these values in our staff and students, and I invite you, to join us on this journey in building OUR caring home, and be our CRESTian leaders!</p>
