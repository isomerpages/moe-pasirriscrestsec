<p align="justify">The school theme for 2025 is a continuation of our journey towards the renewed school vision ‘Our Caring Home, Our CRESTian Leaders’.</p>
<p align="justify">In 2022, we set off, working towards a unified school identity of ‘OUR PRCS’. </p>
<p align="justify">In 2023, we reinforced that unified identity by reminding ourselves, the school values and dispositions that we must embrace and embody and hence, our school theme ‘OUR CREST’. </p>
<p align="justify">In 2024, we amalgamated our school values with the desired behaviour for each Crestian staff and student - ‘Our CRESTian Leaders’, reminding ourselves of self-leadership and role-modelling. </p>
<p align="justify">This year, in 2025, we move beyond self, onto others. We believe and remind ourselves that school is part of a bigger community. With our CREST values, we transform PRCS as a caring home, not just for ourselves and each other within PRCS, but also beyond. ‘Our Caring Home’ thus signifies our commitment towards reinforcing our Culture of Care as a school. More importantly, it demands of us to empathise multiple perspectives, to understand happenings beyond and to contribute towards building a more cohesive community.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Our Caring Home’, the school theme for 2025 is therefore one that directs others-centredness through grounded values and civic literacy.</p>
<p align="justify">Join us, and contribute to Our Caring Home together!</p>
