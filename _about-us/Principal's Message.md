<p align="justify">The school theme for 2024 showcases the continuity in our journey toward achieving our school vision: ‘Our Caring Home, Our CRESTian Leaders’. </p>

<p align="justify">In 2022, we commenced our journey by working towards a unified school identity, encapsulated in ‘OUR PRCS’. </p>

<p align="justify">In 2023, we reinforced that unified identity by reminding ourselves of the school values and dispositions that we must embrace, thus adopting the school theme ‘OUR CREST’.  </p>

<p align="justify">In 2024, we continue building on the progress of the past two years, now focusing on a specific goal for each Crestian staff and student – ‘Our CRESTian Leaders’. </p>

<p align="justify">We believe that every Crestian can be a leader by leading oneself, learning conscientiously, thinking critically and serving wholeheartedly. A CRESTian leader hence is one who demonstrates self-leadership in upholding the school values of Care, Resilience, Excellence, Self-Belief and Trustworthiness, in beliefs, actions and words. </p>

<p align="justify">‘Our CRESTian Leaders’ refers to both our staff and our students. As staff, we aim to role model the school values and desired self-leadership, thereby inspiring our students to do the same. We aspire to speak and act with conviction in line with these values, guiding us toward self-leadership and enabling us to lead others as well. As students, our goal is to comprehend and embody these school values. We must lead ourselves and hold ourselves accountable for these values, thereby nurturing a moral culture and reminding others to uphold them too. </p>

<p align="justify">‘Our CRESTian Leaders’ symbolises a unified effort and a shared vision. </p>

<p align="justify">I invite you to join us on this journey, carry this shared vision and partner with us to realise it! </p>
