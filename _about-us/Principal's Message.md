Principal's Message
===================

![Principal_PRCS.jpg](https://prcss.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u200/pdf/images/principal/Principal_PRCS.jpg)A warm welcome to Pasir Ris Crest Secondary!

  

When you enter our campus, you will see the phrase ‘Home of the Overcomers’, shining beautifully under the warm rays. Indeed, this is our home, our PRCS, where we want all of you to be able to find your place, your growth, and strength to take on and overcome any challenge in life

  

Every year, we have a school theme to galvanise our efforts and guide our focus as we commit to achieving the school’s vision and mission.

For 2022, the school theme is **‘OUR PRCS’**.

A simple phrase made weighty due to the determiner ‘OUR’. OUR is a powerful word with deep meaning. It symbolises collective belonging and emphasises the focus and priority as a school to develop collective ownership in what do, by staff, students and stakeholders. 

  

‘OUR’ represents Ownership-Unity-Responsiveness.

  

It speaks of the co-ownership and co-construction of a unified school culture and design that is responsive to the evolving needs of our people and environment.

It also reminds us that each Crestian (staff and student alike) has a role to play.

  

How will we do that? What will be required of the staff and students?

  

For staff, we must

> *   (Ownership) Have a learner mindset and be proactive in continuous learning and innovation
> *   (Unity) Strengthen and support each other through open communications, collaborations and learning as a team
> *   (Responsiveness) Enhance our capacities to reach out to each student’s diverse needs so as to nurture and develop them as future ready learner and leader

  

For students, we must

> *   (Ownership) Have a learner’s mindset and seek intellectual humility by recognising that there is learning opportunity at every place and with everyone
> *   (Unity) Encourage and support each other as a student body towards inclusivity, improvements and positive self-belief
> *   (Responsiveness) Grow our self-directedness in learning through active and engaged participation and questioning

  

Only then, will PRCS, as a school, be able to

> *   (Ownership) Honour our culture of Care, Positive Self-Belief and Excellence and perpetuate them for the benefit of all staff and students
> *   (Unity) Strengthen our unified spirit as Crestian and of an Overcomer who can realise our potential and challenges
> *   (Responsiveness) Be ready and adapt to the current and future demands of a world yet to be fully written but belongs to all of us.

  

I invite you, to join us on this journey, in building our home, OUR PRCS!
