<p align="justify">The school theme for 2026 is a continuation of our journey towards the renewed school vision and mission of <b>‘Our Caring Home, Our CRESTian Leaders’ and ‘A Choice school that nurtures the Hearts and Minds of Crestian Leaders to be the pride of family, community and nation’.</b></p>
<p align="justify">In 2023, with a renewed set of school values, we made effort to dive deep and remind ourselves of our school values and dispositions that we must embrace and embody and hence, our school theme ‘OUR CREST’. In 2024, we amalgamated our school values with the desired behaviour for each Crestian staff and student - ‘Our CRESTian Leaders’, reminding ourselves of self-leadership and role-modelling. In 2025, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the school and remind ourselves of what PRCS stands for. The theme ‘Our Caring Home’ signified our commitment towards reinforcing our Culture of Care as a school.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, in 2026, we enter the second half of a decade and the school theme <b>‘We are PRCS’</b> calls us to live out our purpose in our school Mission and Vision. This shared identity shapes how we think, act, and grow together as a learning community, guiding our students and staff towards meaningful learning, purposeful leadership, and positive impact.</p>
<p align="justify">At PRCS, we express our shared identity through how we Grow, Glow, and Give, living out the school values we uphold.<br>
<b>Grow</b> - Growth begins with the belief that improvement is possible. Crestians learn to embrace feedback and work steadily towards their goals — showing <i>resilience</i> when challenges stretch them and <i>excellence</i> when they improve through effort. Staff guide students with encouragement and clarity, reinforcing the message that consistent work builds confidence and <i>self-belief</i>.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Glow</b> - Students shine when they express themselves purposefully and act with integrity. Crestians communicate confidently, collaborate thoughtfully, and model responsibility — demonstrating <i>trustworthiness</i> in how they follow through on their words. They discover that confidence is not simply about speaking up, but about speaking up with <i>care</i> and conviction.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Give</b> - Giving is how we put learning and character into action. Crestians contribute time, attention, and effort to strengthen school and community — showing care in how they support peers and appreciation for the opportunities they receive. Staff model generosity through collaboration and encouragement, strengthening the culture of service in our <i>caring</i> home.</p>
<p align="justify">At PRCS, we Grow through challenge, Glow with confidence, and Give with generosity, grounded in our values of Care, Resilience, Excellence, Self-Belief, and Trustworthiness — nurturing Crestians who believe in themselves, strive for excellence, and contribute meaningfully to the world around them.

<p align="justify">This is who we are. We are PRCS!</p>
