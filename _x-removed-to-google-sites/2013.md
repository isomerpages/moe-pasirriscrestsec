### Student-Centric Focus
At the end of 2012, in the review of the school’s strategic directions, the 5 Desired Student Learning Outcomes were developed to lend greater focus our value proposition to all stakeholders:

\- An Active and Engaged Learner<br>
\- An Innovative Problem-solver<br>
\- An Effective Communicator<br>
\- A Self-disciplined and Responsible Leader<br>
\- An Active and Concerned Citizen with Global Awareness

At the same review, whilst keeping its vision to be “A Choice School, A Caring Home”, the school refined its Mission to “Nurture TOMORROW’S Learners, who are the pride of the family, Society and Nation, TODAY” to lend greater emphasis on nurturing life-long learners who are ready for the future.

Indeed, PRCS has come a long way since its inception and is now among the top choice for both staff and students seeking a secondary school with achievements in the academic and co-curricular areas. It continues to nurture Crestians Overcomers with good academic grounding and sound character ready to pursue and realize challenges in life!
