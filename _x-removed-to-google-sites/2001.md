### Fencing
In 2001, Fencing was also offered as a unique co-curricular activity for our students. The PRCS Fencing Club was formed with twenty members. In 2003, our fencers competed against other schools in the First Minime Fencing Championships and clinched Gold and Bronze medals. Our fencers went on to take part in National Fencing Competitions and have done the school proud with excellent results, with some of our fencers chosen to represent Singapore at international competitions. Since then the school has produced many outstanding fencers at the National Level.
    
In 2009, Pasir Ris Crest was accorded the Niche School (Fencing) status. The school was also selected to house the Junior Sports Academy for Fencing based on excellent achievement track records, the fencing culture and management support.
